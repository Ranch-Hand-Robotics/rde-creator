# AI-Powered ROS Package Generation

This extension now supports AI-powered ROS 2 package generation using VS Code's Language Model API. This feature allows you to:

1. **Use Natural Language Descriptions**: Instead of manually configuring every aspect of your ROS package, you can describe what you want in plain English
2. **Intelligent Template Adaptation**: The AI analyzes your template structure and adapts it based on your requirements
3. **Contextual Code Generation**: Generate ROS nodes, launch files, and configurations that match your specific use case

## How It Works

1. **Template Analysis**: The AI reads your template files and manifest to understand the structure
2. **Parameter Integration**: User-provided parameters (package name, maintainer, etc.) are incorporated
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Your description is analyzed to understand the desired functionality
4. **Intelligent Generation**: The AI generates a complete, functional ROS 2 package

## Example Usage

When creating a package, you can provide a description like:

> "Create a ROS 2 publisher node that reads temperature sensor data from a serial port and publishes it to a topic at 5Hz. Include proper error handling and logging."

The AI will then:
- Generate appropriate Python/C++ node code
- Create launch files with correct parameters
- Set up proper dependencies in package.xml
- Include error handling and logging as requested

## Example AI Generation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Publisher Node
**Description**: "Create a simple ROS 2 publisher that publishes a string message 'Hello World' every second"

**Expected Output**: A basic Python publisher node with appropriate launch file and package configuration.

### Scenario 2: Sensor Processing Node
**Description**: "Build a ROS 2 node that subscribes to laser scan data, processes it to detect obstacles, and publishes warning messages when obstacles are too close"

**Expected Output**: 
- Python node with laser scan subscription
- Obstacle detection algorithm
- Warning publisher
- Launch file with remappings
- Proper QoS settings

### Scenario 3: Multi-Component System
**Description**: "Create a complete ROS 2 package for a mobile robot with odometry publisher, velocity command subscriber, and PID controller for motor commands"

**Expected Output**:
- Odometry calculation and publishing
- Velocity command processing
- PID controller implementation
- Motor command publishing
- Launch file for the complete system
- Configuration files for PID parameters

## Technical Implementation

The AI generation process involves:

1. **Template Reading**: All template files are read and provided as context
2. **Manifest Analysis**: Package options and file mappings are analyzed
3. **Parameter Substitution**: User variables are applied to the template
4. **AI Prompt Construction**: A comprehensive prompt is built with all context
5. **Model Interaction**: VS Code's language model processes the request
6. **Response Processing**: AI-generated content is parsed and applied
7. **File Generation**: Complete package structure is created

## Best Practices for AI Descriptions

- **Be Specific**: Clearly describe the ROS concepts (topics, services, messages)
- **Include Rates**: Specify publication/subscription frequencies when relevant
- **Mention Dependencies**: Note any required ROS packages or external libraries
- **Specify Language**: Indicate preference for Python or C++ if important
- **Describe Behavior**: Explain what the node should do in different scenarios

## Fallback Mechanism

If AI generation fails for any reason (network issues, API unavailability, etc.), the extension automatically falls back to the traditional template-based generation method.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.90+ (for Language Model API support)
- GitHub Copilot Chat extension (recommended for best results)
- Internet connection for AI model access
