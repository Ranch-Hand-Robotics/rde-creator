version: 0.0.0
description: A template for representing resources like launch files, urdf files, meshes, etc.
license: "MIT"
ai_directive: |
  This is a ROS 2 resource package template. When generating code for this template:
  
  HIGH PRIORITY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Focus on creating resource files (URDF, meshes, launch files, configuration files)
  - Ensure all file paths and references are correctly structured
  - Include proper ROS 2 package structure for resource packages
  - Add appropriate dependencies for the included resources
  - Follow ROS 2 naming conventions for all generated files
  - Include comprehensive documentation for the resource package
  - Use python package best practices for any scripts included in the package
  - Do not include test cases, unless specifically prompted by the user
  
  RESOURCE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
  - URDF files should be well-formed XML with proper joint and link definitions
  - Launch files should use modern ROS 2 launch API (not legacy launch)
  - Mesh files should be properly referenced in URDF with correct relative paths
  - Include parameter files for configurable resource parameters
  - Add proper error handling for resource loading failures
  - If you need to generate more than just simple geometry, create OpenSCAD files for complex meshes. 
  - OpenSCAD files will be post processed to stl files, so reference the stl files in the URDF or Xacro.

  IMPORTANT: The file "resource/package_name" must be an EMPTY FILE, not a directory.
  This is a ROS 2 convention for ament resource indexing.

  Setup.cfg must include:
  ```ini
    [develop]
    script_dir=$base/lib/package_name
    [install]
    install_scripts=$base/lib/package_name
  ```
